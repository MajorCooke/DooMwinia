	Darwinia Buildings - Radar Dish
	
	A utility building that allows transportation of units like Darwinians
	and Squaddies. If at any point a link is broken, any units travelling from
	the breaking link will instantly die. The dish can only be rotated to face
	other radar dishes that are in a line of sight to prevent cheating.
